# minds-matter

An interactive explorer for data from a survey about the relationship between consciousness and moral status. 

## About the Survey

This survey explored what people think about **moral status** (e.g., who has it?), **consciousness** (e.g., who has it?!), and **the relationship between them** (e.g., what is the role of consciousness in moral status attributions?)

Respondents were asked a combination of: 
- Direct questions (e.g., "Do you think non-conscious creatures/systems should be taken into account in moral decisions?") 
- Indirect questions (e.g., "Do you think a creature/system can have intentions/goals without being conscious?")
- Moral dilemmas (e.g., about zombification - Siewert 1998; and Vulcans - Chalmers, 2014)
With both forced-choice, ratings, and open-ended questions (free text), 

## Using the Explorer

Visit the [interactive explorer](https://RonyHirsch.github.io/minds-matter) to:

- View distributions of responses to individual questions
- Cross-tabulate survey responses with demographics and expertise
- Browse free-text responses (shown without identifying information)

## Privacy Protections

To protect participant anonymity, the explorer only presents aggregated data, without individual survey responses. 
To prevent re-identification of respondents:

- **Minimum aggregation**: Any aggregation with fewer than 5 respondents is hidden (a standard [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) threshold)
- **Restricted cross-tabulations**: Demographic variables cannot be combined in ways that could isolate individuals (e.g., country × age × gender)
- **Decoupled free-text**: Open-ended responses are displayed without links to any respondent characteristics
